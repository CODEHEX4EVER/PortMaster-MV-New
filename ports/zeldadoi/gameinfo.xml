		<desc>The Legend of Zelda: Dungeons of Infinity is the result of four years of development in Gamemaker Studio from its creator Justin Bohemier. The game makes use of a number of A Link to the Past's original assets to really capture the same aesthetic, with new features and assets added to support the new procedurally-generated dungeon crawling.</desc>
