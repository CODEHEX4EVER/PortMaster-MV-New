INSTALLATION NOTES:
-----------------------------------------------------------


REDBOOK CD AUDIO

Lode Runner contains digitally master redbook CD audio tracks
on the CD.  These are the same type of tracks you would have
on any audio CD, and the Lode Runner music can be played just
like any other music you would put in a CD player.  The Lode 
Runner audio tracks begin at track #2, so you must skip over 
track #1 (the data track) when you want to hear the music on
a regular CD player.

If you have music enabled and the CD is in your computer CD
drive and your hardware and software are correctly configured, 
Lode Runner will play these audio tracks during the course of 
the game.  You may experience pauses during game play while the
CD seeks to play different music tracks.  If you find these pauses
unacceptable, you simply have to disable music from the game
configuration panel.


MODEM PLAY ISSUES

For adequate modem play, you must have a clear connection at
9600+ baud.  Also, it necessary to configure your modem NOT to
use Error Correction.  Error Correction may be disabled by 
unchecking the appropriate option in the dialog found by selecting
"Properties/Connection/Advanced" within the Modems Applet of
the Win95 Control Panel.	

Also, note that once you are finished with a game and the modem
has hung up, it is necessary to exit Lode Runner and then 
restart the game prior to playing another modem game. This is 
a known issue using the present versions of DirectX and Win95. 
Future revisions of either DirectX, Windows, or Lode Runner may 
alleviate this problem.


UNINSTALLING LODE RUNNER ONLINE

To properly uninstall Lode Runner Online, you should select
the "Lode Runner Uninstaller" icon that was created in your Sierra
program group during installation.  If you uninstall by using the
Sierra Setup program, not all information will be removed from the
Win95 registry.  If this happens, you may clean up the Win95
registry by selecting the "Add/Remove Programs" Applet on the 
Win95 Control Panel. You will then need to select "Lode Runner 
Online" from the list of installed applications and press the 
"Add/Remove" button. This action will completely purge Lode Runner
from your system.
