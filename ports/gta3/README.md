## Notes

Thanks to halpz and the [re3](https://github.com/halpz/re3) project, and [Nosro1](https://github.com/nosro1/re3) for porting it.

## Installation

Copy all files from the original game into `ports/gta3/`.

The game requires assets from the classic version released in 2002 (not the Definitive Edition, 2021).
Versions from Steam (no longer available to buy) and Rockstar Store are confirmed to work fine.

If needed, readjust analog sticks sensitivity/deadzone by changing
[Left,Right]StickSens[X,Y] or [Left,Right]StickDeadzone values in reVC.ini.
