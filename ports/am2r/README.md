## Notes

You'll need to source your own am2r android apk and place it into the `ports/am2r/gamedata` folder. Make sure it is named `am2r.apk`. If need be, just rename the am2r apk you source to `am2r.apk`. The name is case sensitive!

You can patch your `am2r_v1.1.apk` file with the [AM2RLauncher](https://github.com/AM2R-Community-Developers/AM2RLauncher), which will at time of writing bring the game version to 1.5.5.

Thanks to JohnnyonFlame for the[ droidports](https://github.com/JohnnyonFlame/droidports) loader that makes this possible.
